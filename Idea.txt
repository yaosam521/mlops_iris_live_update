The idea is to get a handle on how to deploy ML Models to production, Hence MLOps. 
The idea is to start with a basic ML Model, trained on something like the iris dataset

Directions:
1. Train an ML Model on the iris dataset
2. Pickle the Model
3. Create an interface to classify various flowers based upon length
4. Figure out the Web Server and writing an API to get and post to the Model
5. Publish on Github
